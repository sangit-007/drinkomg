Command to find Hacked and Malicious script in cpanel website:
==============================================================

grep -lr "string"

Where "string" is a few characters from the entire encoded file (I don't always use the first "eval" characters, but take 12 to 16 characters out of the middle; less false positives that way)

grep -r 'eval(' /home/*/public_html/*php

find /home/ | xargs grep 'text' -sl

I realized this is a better way to find the string. And its easy as you can get a c99 or any such shell and grab a piece of text from it.
